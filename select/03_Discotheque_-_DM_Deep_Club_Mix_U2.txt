You can reach
But you can't grab it
You can hold it, control it
You can't bag it, ah
You can push
But you can't direct it
Circulate, regulate, oh no
You cannot connect it
You know you're chewing bubblegum
You know what that is but you still want some
You just can't get enough
Of that lovie, dovie stuff
You get confused
But you know it
Yeah, you hurt for it, work for it, love
You don't always show it
Let go
Let's go
Let's go
Discotheque
Hi, come on child
Oh
Let go
Let go
Discotheque
You're looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead
You want to be the song
Be the song that you hear in your head
Love
Ooo, love
Love
It's not a trick
'Cause you can't learn it
It's the way you don't pay, that's okay
'Cause you can't earn it, yeah
You know you're chewing bubblegum
You know what that is but you still want some
You just can't get enough
Of that lovie, dovie stuff
Let go
Let go
Oh oh oh
Discotheque
Come on, come on
Go girl
Go girl
Ah ha ha
Discotheque
I want you
I want you
Oh, ooo, oh
Mmm love mmm
You're looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead
You want to be the song
Be the song that you hear in your head
Love
You want heaven in your heart
Heaven in your heart
The sun, the moon, and the stars
But you take what you can get
'Cause it's all that you can find
But you know there's something more
But tonight, tonight, tonight
Ah, high
High, high
High, high
High, high
Boom cha, boom cha, discotheque
Boom cha, boom cha, discotheque
I paid, get in, I can't, not enough
Boom cha, boom cha, discotheque
I paid, get in, I can't, not enough
Boom cha, boom cha, discotheque
I paid, get in, I can't, not enough
Boom cha, boom cha, discotheque
Boom cha, boom cha, discotheque
