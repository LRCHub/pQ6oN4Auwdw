I've been driving, all night, through the Tennessee mountains
I can't see shit on a road with no name
But I don't give a damn
'Cause somebody told me, told me
There's a party going on down in the woods
Calling all the freaks, I said all the freaks, freaks across the land

And I know I better brace myself
I'm going to another place
Gonna shake my ass
Gonna move my legs
Gonna kiss your face

One night in the backwoods can change your life
By the full moon light, that's right at the backwoods discotheque
You believe in a good time, that's right
You're gonna find it there, prepare for a real good time at the discotheque yeah

Cos I've been hurting, since my baby left me, for another, another man like myself
With a situation that's way beyond me
I wish I could tell that man to go to hell
But in these woods, trash talk will get you nowhere
The forest creatures leave you by yourself
But you gotta get ready, ready for the party, because you gonna go someplace else

And I know I better brace myself
I'm going to another place
Gonna shake my ass
Gonna move my legs
Gonna kiss your face

One night in the backwoods can change your life
By the full moon light, that's right at the backwoods discotheque
You believe in a good time that's right, you're gonna find it there
Prepare for a real good time at the discotheque yeah

Let's all go to the backwoods discotheque
Let's go get wrecked with the sweat, yeah
If you gotta car and a kinky girl you'll get wet right quick at the discotheque yeah

No one knows who goes to the backwoods club
And rubs their nubs in the sludge bugs
If you got booze and a dirty boy, you're gonna love that club at the discotheque yeah

Let's all go to the backwoods discotheque
Let's go get wrecked with the sweat, yeah
If you got booze and a dirty boy, you're gonna
You'll get wet right quick at the discotheque yeah

One night in the backwoods can change your life, by the full moon light that's right at the backwoods discotheque
You believe in a good time that's right, you're gonna find it there, prepare for a real good time at the discotheque yeah
One night in the backwoods can change your life, by the full moon light that's right at the backwoods discotheque
You believe in a good time that's right, you're gonna find it there, prepare for a real good time at the discotheque yeah
