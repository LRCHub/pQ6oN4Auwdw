You can reach
But you can't grab it
You can hold it, control it
No, you can't bag it

You can push
(You can push)
But you can't direct it
(But you can't direct it)
Circulate, regulate, oh no
You can't connect it
(You cannot connect it)

You know you're chewing bubblegum
You know what that is
But you still want some
You just can't get enough
Of that lovey dovey stuff

Let's go
Let's go
Discothèque

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Discothèque

You get confused
But you love it
Yeah, you hurt for it, work for it, love
You don't always show it

You want to be the one
But you know you're someone else instead
You want to be the song
Be the songs you're hearing, yeah

Let's go
Let's go
Discothèque

Go, go
Go, go
Discothèque
(Discothèque)

Love
Love (Discothèque)
Love (Discothèque)
(You want heaven in your heart)
(Heaven in your heart)

But you take what you can get
'Cause it's all that you can find
But you know there's something more
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Let's go
Let's go
Discothèque

Go, go
Go, go
Discothèque

Love
Love (Discothèque)
(Discothèque)
