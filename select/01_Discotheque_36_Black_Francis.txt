At Discotheque 36 on the Richter Scale
I'd seen you pouring out the ale
My triple sec, feeling like my first skin pop
You tasting like salty drop

Isn't that something how I thought that I'd seen
Every woman that there was to be seen?
Just doing my dumb thing, there to make a scene
I ended up drinking from the stream

Oh, ended up drinking my Alexandra
At Discotheque 36 on the Richter Scale
I'd seen you pouring out the ale

Then comes a day, I was never smart
But I'll leave you with a view of one more classic shot
Now every day feel the good things in your heart
When you look out of the window to this spot

Isn't that something how I thought that I'd seen
Every woman that there was to be seen?
Just doing my dumb thing, there to make a scene
Ended up drinking from the stream
Ended up drinking my Alexandra

Isn't that something how I thought that I'd seen
Every woman that there was to be seen?
Just doing my dumb thing, there to make a scene
Ended up drinking from the stream
Oh, ended up drinking my Alexandra

Isn't that something?
(Isn't that something?)
Ooh, isn't that something?
(Isn't that something?)

(Isn't that something?)
Isn't that something?
(Isn't that something?)
Isn't that something?
(Isn't that something?)
Isn't that something?
(Isn't that something?)

(Isn't that something?)
(Isn't that something?)
(Isn't that something?)
(Isn't that something?)
(Isn't that something?)
(Isn't that something?)
(Isn't that something?)
